# 📊 Predicting Financial Market Trend Using Economic Indicators: An Investigation Based On State-of-the-art Machine Learning Models

![](./presentation/stock_market.png)

Understanding the financial market is one of the most challenging yet fascinating tasks in economics. This end-to-end data science project explores how key economic indicators—such as GDP, unemployment, and inflation—impact the performance of the stock market, specifically the S&P 500 index. As part of the Ironhack Data Science Bootcamp, this mid-term project blends my passion for financial analysis with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Investigate the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and the stock market.
- Build a comprehensive dataset by collecting and cleaning real-world economic and financial data.
- Conduct detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns.
- Apply state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict S&P 500 trends.
- Evaluate model performance and select the best-performing algorithm.
- Communicate insights through interactive visualizations and a Streamlit app.

## 📚 Data Sources

- **Economic Data:** [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- **Stock Market Data:** [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

## 🛠 Methodology

### 🔹 Data Collection & Wrangling
- Collected macroeconomic and stock market data using FRED API and `yfinance` package.
- Merged time series into a single DataFrame, handled missing values, and engineered new features.
- Final cleaned dataset available in `data_cleaning.ipynb`.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand variable relationships.
- Key plots and visual insights presented in `eda.ipynb`.

### 🔹 Machine Learning Modeling
- Applied linear models and tree-based models to predict S&P 500 direction.
- Evaluated performance and selected the best model.
- Implementation and results in `supervised_ml_classification.ipynb`.

### 🔹 Streamlit Web App
- Built an interactive app to visualize model predictions and explore the dataset.
- Run it locally with:
  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit.py
  ```

## 📈 Key Insights
-  📉 The S&P 500 saw sharp declines during key historical events like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
-  🔗 Strong correlations exist between economic indicators and market performance — e.g., unemployment rate and housing data.
-  ✅ Linear regression models performed surprisingly well, offering high interpretability and solid accuracy.
-  📊 Visualizations such as heatmaps, time series trends, and scatter plots reveal economic dynamics influencing the stock market.
